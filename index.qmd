# Strategy: Pairs Trading

## Features
- A market-neutral trading strategy that identifies two correlated assets and exploits temporary price divergences
- Traders long the underperforming asset and short the outperforming asset, assuming they will revert to their historical relationship.

## How It works
::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="50%"}
1. Identify a Pair (e.g., stocks in the same industry: KO vs. PEP).
2. Measure Correlation (using statistical tests like cointegration).
3. Define Entry & Exit Rules (e.g., trading when price ratio deviates from mean by 2 standard deviations).

4. Execute Trades (Long underperformer, Short outperformer).
5. Close Position when spread reverts to the mean.

## Assets Chosen
1. Identifying Candidate Pairs
- Start by selecting assets that have a fundamental or economic relationship, such as:
    - Stocks within the same industry (e.g., Coca-Cola & Pepsi, Visa & Mastercard)
    - ETF pairs (e.g., SPY & IVV, QQQ & XLK)
    - Commodity-related pairs (e.g., Oil & Natural Gas, Gold & Silver)
    - Currency pairs (e.g., EUR/USD & GBP/USD)
    - Bond pairs (e.g., U.S. Treasuries of different maturities)
2. Checking Stock Correlation
- Pearson correlation (short-term relationship) – A high correlation (>0.8) suggests similar movements
- Rolling correlation
- Hedge Ratio Calculation – Use OLS to estimate hedge ratio
3. Statistical Cointegration Analysis
- Test for cointegration to ensure the pair moves together in the long run. Use:
- Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test: To check if the spread between the two assets is stationary.
- Engle-Granger Test: Tests whether two assets are cointegrated.
- Johansen Test: More advanced test for multiple time series.

## Case: XOM vs CVX

```{python}
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame([
    ["ADF Test Statistic", -3.196164524303477],
    ["Johansen Cointegration Test", 21.9011],
    ["Correlation coefficient", 0.14438665928752528]
], columns=["Metrics", "Value"])
df
```
### Entry signals:
- If the z-score of the spread between the two assets exceeds +2, it indicates that asset A is overvalued relative to asset B. The strategy enters a position by shorting A and longing B, expecting the spread to revert to the mean.
- If the z-score falls below -2, it indicates that asset A is undervalued relative to asset B. The strategy enters a position by longing A and shorting B, again expecting mean reversion.

### Exit signals:
- If the absolute value of the z-score drops below 0.5, the spread is considered to have mean-reverted. The strategy takes profit by closing the position.
- If the z-score moves further away and exceeds ±3, the spread is diverging instead of reverting. The strategy triggers a stop-loss to cut potential losses.
