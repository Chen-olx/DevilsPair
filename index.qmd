## The Pairs Trading Process {.mt-5}

:::: {.callout-tip .mb-4}
## Our Systematic Approach
Following a structured, data-driven methodology ensures consistency and removes emotional bias from trading decisions.
::::

:::: {.process-flow .p-4 .bg-dark .rounded}

::: {.process-step .mb-4 .p-3 .border .border-primary .rounded}
### 1. Identify Pairs
- Industry competitors (e.g., XOM/CVX in energy, KO/PEP in beverages)
- Companies with shared supply chains or market exposures
- Securities tracking similar underlying assets (ETF pairs)
- Assets with clear economic linkages (gold miners and gold prices)
:::

::: {.process-step .mb-4 .p-3 .border .border-primary .rounded}
### 2. Measure Correlation
- Calculate Pearson correlation coefficients (target > 0.8)
- Analyze rolling correlation for stability over time
- Test correlation across multiple market conditions
- Examine behavior during market stress periods
:::

::: {.process-step .mb-4 .p-3 .border .border-primary .rounded}
### 3. Test Cointegration
- Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test for spread stationarity
- Engle-Granger test for cointegrating relationship
- Johansen test for additional validation
- Half-life calculation to estimate mean reversion timeframe
:::

::: {.process-step .mb-4 .p-3 .border .border-primary .rounded}
### 4. Define Trading Rules
- Entry thresholds at 2 standard deviations from mean
- Exit signals calibrated to historical reversion patterns
- Position sizing based on volatility and confidence
- Maximum holding periods aligned with half-life estimates
:::

::: {.process-step .mb-4 .p-3 .border .border-primary .rounded}
### 5. Execute Trades
- Long position in underperforming asset
- Short position in outperforming asset
- Hedged ratio for dollar neutrality
- Execution timing optimized for minimal market impact
:::

::: {.process-step .mb-4 .p-3 .border .border-primary .rounded}
### 6. Close Position
- Primary exit at mean reversion point
- Secondary exits based on time or stop-loss triggers
- Position unwinding to minimize trading costs
- Performance analysis for strategy refinement
