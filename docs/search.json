This helps identify pairs with consistent relationships and highlight potential structural breaks.\nThe analysis of rolling correlations reveals how relationships can shift over time. For example, when examining historical data, we often observe structural breaks that might indicate fundamental changes in the relationship between assets. The shorter 60-day window typically reveals these changes more quickly than the 120-day window, allowing us to respond promptly to evolving market conditions.\n\n\nCorrelation Stability\nWe calculate the standard deviation of rolling correlation to measure relationship consistency. Lower values indicate more stable pairs with predictable behavior, which is critical for minimizing unexpected divergence risk.\nCorrelation Stability Metrics for Selected Pairs:\n\n\n\nPair\nMean Correlation\nCorrelation StdDev\nStability Score\n\n\n\n\nXOM/CVX\n0.89\n0.07\n9.3\n\n\nMSFT/AAPL\n0.85\n0.12\n8.8\n\n\nJPM/BAC\n0.88\n0.08\n9.2\n\n\nSPY/IVV\n0.99\n0.01\n9.9\n\n\nKO/PEP\n0.82\n0.09\n9.1\n\n\nHD/LOW\n0.84\n0.11\n8.9\n\n\n\nPairs with higher stability scores (lower standard deviation of correlation) tend to provide more reliable trading opportunities with more predictable mean reversion behavior."

    "section": "Spread Analysis",
    "text": "Spread Analysis\nOnce pairs are validated through correlation and cointegration testing, we analyze their spread characteristics.\n\nSpread Calculation\nThe spread between paired assets is computed as:\n\\text{Spread} = \\log(Price_A) - \\log(Price_B)\nThe logarithmic transformation normalizes price scales. Alternatively, we sometimes use the ratio method for certain pair types:\n\\text{Ratio Spread} = \\frac{Price_A}{Price_B}\nBoth approaches are adjusted for the hedge ratio to maintain dollar neutrality.\nThe log spread and ratio spread calculations capture slightly different aspects of the relationship between paired assets. While both approaches identify mean-reverting behavior, the log spread is preferred for pairs with significant price level differences, as it normalizes the relationship on a percentage basis.\n\n\nZ-Score Transformation\nWe normalize the spread to measure deviation from equilibrium using the Z-score:\n\\text{Z-score} = \\frac{\\text{Spread} - \\text{Mean(Spread)}}{\\text{Std(Spread)}}\nThis is calculated using rolling windows (typically 20-30 days) and provides a standardized measure for trade signals.\nOur trading system generates signals based on Z-score thresholds. Typical entry points occur when the Z-score exceeds +2 or falls below -2, indicating a significant deviation from the mean relationship. The mean (Z-score = 0) represents our target exit point, while additional boundaries at +1 and -1 may serve as early warning indicators or conservative exit points.\n\n\nHalf-Life Estimation\nTo understand how quickly the spread returns to its mean, we estimate the half-life using an AR(1) model:\n\\text{Half-life} = \\frac{-\\ln(2)}{\\ln(\\rho)}\nWhere \\rho is the coefficient from the regression of the spread’s change on its lagged value. This calculation helps us determine appropriate holding periods and set expectations for trade duration.\nIn our universe of tradable pairs, most half-lives fall between 5 and 15 trading days, indicating relatively quick mean reversion. Pairs with very short half-lives (1-3 days) typically offer more frequent trading opportunities but smaller returns per trade, while pairs with longer half-lives (15-30 days) often provide larger returns but with fewer opportunities."

    "section": "Signal Generation",
    "text": "Signal Generation\nOur trading signals are derived from statistical analysis of spread behavior.\n\nEntry Signals\nWe trigger entry signals when the Z-score exceeds predetermined thresholds: - Typical entry when |Z-score| &gt; 2.0 (2 standard deviations) - Direction determined by sign of Z-score (negative Z-score: long first asset, short second asset) - Additional filters may include momentum indicators to avoid “catching falling knives”\nOur entry logic is designed to identify significant divergences from the mean relationship. When the Z-score exceeds +2, we go short the first asset and long the second; when it falls below -2, we take the opposite position. This approach systematically captures mean-reversion opportunities while maintaining mathematical rigor.\n\n\nExit Signals\nWe employ several exit strategies: - Primary exit when Z-score returns to mean (0) or crosses specified threshold - Time-based exits determined by spread half-life estimate - Stop-loss triggers based on adverse Z-score movement - Take-profit levels customized for each pair’s historical behavior\nOur exit mechanisms ensure disciplined trade management. The primary exit occurs when the spread normalizes, but we also incorporate time-based exits when positions approach their expected half-life. Stop-loss triggers protect against unexpected divergence continuation, while take-profit levels capture gains at statistically optimal points.\n\n\nPosition Sizing\nWe determine position sizes based on: - Historical volatility of the spread - Statistical confidence in the cointegration relationship - Overall portfolio risk allocation - Current market volatility conditions\nThe formula below represents our base position sizing calculation:\n\\text{Position Size} = \\frac{\\text{Risk Allocation}}{\\text{Pair Volatility} \\times \\text{Stop Loss Distance}}\nThis approach ensures consistent risk exposure across different pairs regardless of their individual characteristics."

This dynamic adjustment ensures that we maintain consistent risk levels regardless of market conditions.\n\n\nVIX Integration\nWe incorporate the VIX market volatility index as an adjustment factor: - Raising entry thresholds during high-VIX environments - Reducing holding periods when market stress increases - Adjusting position sizes inversely to market volatility\nThe formula for adjusted Z-score thresholds is:\n\\text{Adjusted Z-threshold} = \\text{Base Z-threshold} \\times \\left(1 + \\alpha \\times \\frac{\\text{VIX} - \\text{VIX}_{\\text{avg}}}{\\text{VIX}_{\\text{avg}}}\\right)\nWhere \\alpha is a sensitivity parameter calibrated to historical performance.\n\n\nVolume Analysis\nWe monitor trading volume for liquidity assessment and: - Adjust position sizing based on available liquidity - Identify potential liquidity-driven divergences - Optimize execution timing to minimize market impact - Validate signal quality during unusual volume conditions\nVolume analysis provides crucial context for our trading decisions. Abnormal volume may indicate potential liquidity-driven divergences rather than statistical arbitrage opportunities, allowing us to filter out potentially unprofitable signals."

    "text": "Challenges and Considerations\nWhile the overall performance is strong, several factors warrant attention:\n\nCorrelation Stability: The negative stability score (-21.716) indicates significant variations in the correlation between XOM and CVX over time, which could introduce periods of strategy underperformance.\nLong Half-Life: The relatively long statistical half-life (42.41 days) suggests that some divergences might persist for extended periods, requiring patience and strong risk management.\nVIX Adjustment: The strategy was implemented without VIX-based volatility adjustments. Incorporating market volatility indicators could potentially enhance performance by adjusting position sizing during high-volatility periods.\nMarket Regime Sensitivity: Energy stocks can be subject to distinct market regimes (contango vs. backwardation in oil futures, for example) which may temporarily affect the pair relationship."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThe XOM/CVX pair demonstrates strong characteristics for statistical arbitrage trading, with solid statistical validation and impressive backtest performance. The high win rate, favorable profit factor, and moderate drawdowns all suggest this pair offers a compelling opportunity for market-neutral trading.\nDespite some concerns regarding correlation stability and the relatively long half-life, the actual trading results show that the strategy effectively captures profits from temporary price divergences while maintaining low correlation to broader market movements.\nBased on these results, the XOM/CVX pair represents a prime example of statistical arbitrage potential in the energy sector, offering both strong returns and diversification benefits within a broader investment portfolio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplementation Recommendation\n\n\n\nFor optimal implementation, we recommend:\n\nUsing the established hedge ratio of 0.1816 to maintain market neutrality\nMonitoring correlation stability and adjusting position sizing accordingly\nImplementing a trailing stop-loss strategy during periods of extended divergence\nConsidering additional filters based on energy sector fundamentals"
