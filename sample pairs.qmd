## Energy Sector Pairs: XOM/CVX

This case study examines the performance of a statistical arbitrage strategy using Exxon Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX), two major integrated oil and gas companies with similar business models and market exposures.

![Stock Price Trend Comparison](images/image1_stock_prices.png)

The chart above shows the price movements of XOM (blue line) and CVX (orange line) over our analysis period. Despite the different price scales, the two stocks clearly display similar directional movements, providing the foundation for our pairs trading strategy.

### Fundamental Relationship

Exxon Mobil and Chevron represent an ideal pairing for statistical arbitrage due to their strong fundamental relationship:

* Both are integrated oil majors with similar business models spanning exploration, production, refining, and retail
* Shared exposure to global oil and gas prices as primary profit drivers
* Comparable market capitalization and financial strength profiles
* Similar dividend policies and capital expenditure patterns
* Competing operations across the same geographical regions

This fundamental similarity creates a strong economic rationale for their prices to maintain a consistent relationship over time, despite short-term divergences.

### Statistical Validation

Our comprehensive statistical analysis confirms the strong relationship between XOM and CVX:

| Metric | Value | Interpretation |
|--------|-------|----------------|
| Pearson Correlation | 0.8497 | Strong positive correlation |
| Correlation Std Dev | 0.3172 | Moderate variability in correlation |
| Stability Score | -21.7160 | Correlation shows some instability |

![Rolling Correlation](images/image1_rolling_correlation.png)

The rolling correlation chart above demonstrates the generally strong relationship between XOM and CVX over time. The 60-day rolling correlation (purple line) and 120-day rolling correlation (orange line) both remain mostly above 0.8, though there are periods of significant drops that contribute to the negative stability score.

While the correlation stability shows some concerns, the cointegration tests provide strong evidence for a tradable relationship:

#### Cointegration Test Results

| Test | Statistic | Critical Value (5%) | p-value | Result |
|------|-----------|---------------------|---------|--------|
| ADF Test | -2.9819 | -2.8654 | 0.0366 | Cointegrated ✓ |
| Johansen Trace | 24.4420 | 15.4943 | - | Cointegrated ✓ |

Both tests confirm the presence of cointegration, indicating that while XOM and CVX prices may diverge temporarily, they tend to revert to their long-term equilibrium relationship. The hedge ratio of 0.1816 suggests that for each share of XOM, approximately 0.18 shares of CVX should be traded in the opposite direction to create a market-neutral position.

![Spread Mean-Reverting Series](images/image1_spread.png)

The spread chart above shows the difference between the two stocks (after applying the hedge ratio), demonstrating the mean-reverting property that is essential for pairs trading. While the spread appears non-stationary at times, our statistical tests confirm it is indeed mean-reverting over the analysis period.

### Trading Parameters

Based on our statistical analysis, we established the following trading parameters:

* **Entry Signal**: Z-score exceeding +/- 2.0 standard deviations
* **Exit Signal**: Z-score returning to +/- 0.5 standard deviations
* **Stop-Loss**: Z-score exceeding +/- 3.0 standard deviations
* **Half-Life**: 42.41 days (relatively long)
* **Maximum Holding Period**: 63 days (1.5× half-life)

The half-life analysis indicates that while mean reversion does occur, it happens at a relatively slow pace. This suggests a medium-term trading horizon for this pair.

![Z-Score with Trading Signals](images/image1_zscore.png)

The Z-score chart above shows the normalized spread with our entry and exit thresholds. When the Z-score crosses above +2 or below -2 (red dashed lines), we enter a trade in the direction of mean reversion. The frequent oscillation of the Z-score around these thresholds provides numerous trading opportunities.

## Trading Performance

Our backtest of the XOM/CVX pair trading strategy demonstrates impressive results over the test period:

![Equity Curve](images/image2_equity_curve.png)

The equity curve above shows the growth of our initial $10,000 capital over the testing period. The steady upward trend demonstrates the consistent profitability of the strategy, reaching over $13,600 by the end of the period.

![Drawdown Analysis](images/image2_drawdown.png)

The drawdown chart above shows the percentage decline from peak equity values throughout the testing period. The maximum drawdown of 13.38% is moderate and reflects the strategy's effective risk management, especially considering the volatile nature of energy stocks.

### Trading Signals Visualization

![Z-Score and Trading Positions](images/image2_zscore_positions.png)

The chart above displays our Z-score with actual trading positions marked: green triangles for long positions (long XOM, short CVX) and red triangles for short positions (short XOM, long CVX). The vertical dotted lines indicate trade entry and exit points, demonstrating how the strategy captures mean-reverting moves.

### Strategy Insights

Several key observations emerge from our trading results:

1. **High Win Rate**: The 77.50% win rate confirms the strong mean-reversion tendency between XOM and CVX, validating our statistical approach.

2. **Asymmetric Risk-Reward**: While average losses (-$198.13) are larger than average wins ($111.25), the high win rate more than compensates, resulting in a strong profit factor of 1.93.

3. **Reasonable Drawdowns**: The maximum drawdown of 13.38% is well within acceptable limits for a market-neutral strategy, indicating effective risk management.

4. **Efficient Holding Period**: Despite the relatively long half-life estimate (42.41 days), actual trades averaged just 11.75 days, suggesting that mean reversion often occurs faster than the statistical estimate.

5. **Risk-Adjusted Performance**: The Sharpe ratio (0.79) and particularly the Sortino ratio (0.90) demonstrate good risk-adjusted returns, with especially strong performance during downside market moves.

## Challenges and Considerations

While the overall performance is strong, several factors warrant attention:

1. **Correlation Stability**: The negative stability score (-21.716) indicates significant variations in the correlation between XOM and CVX over time, which could introduce periods of strategy underperformance.

2. **Long Half-Life**: The relatively long statistical half-life (42.41 days) suggests that some divergences might persist for extended periods, requiring patience and strong risk management.

3. **VIX Adjustment**: The strategy was implemented without VIX-based volatility adjustments. Incorporating market volatility indicators could potentially enhance performance by adjusting position sizing during high-volatility periods.

4. **Market Regime Sensitivity**: Energy stocks can be subject to distinct market regimes (contango vs. backwardation in oil futures, for example) which may temporarily affect the pair relationship.

## Conclusion

The XOM/CVX pair demonstrates strong characteristics for statistical arbitrage trading, with solid statistical validation and impressive backtest performance. The high win rate, favorable profit factor, and moderate drawdowns all suggest this pair offers a compelling opportunity for market-neutral trading.

Despite some concerns regarding correlation stability and the relatively long half-life, the actual trading results show that the strategy effectively captures profits from temporary price divergences while maintaining low correlation to broader market movements.

Based on these results, the XOM/CVX pair represents a prime example of statistical arbitrage potential in the energy sector, offering both strong returns and diversification benefits within a broader investment portfolio.

## Implementation Recommendation
For optimal implementation, we recommend:

1. Using the established hedge ratio of 0.1816 to maintain market neutrality
2. Monitoring correlation stability and adjusting position sizing accordingly
3. Implementing a trailing stop-loss strategy during periods of extended divergence
4. Considering additional filters based on energy sector fundamentals
